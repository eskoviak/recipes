Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Finely chop the dates and figs; place in the ½ cup water and let sit.  This can be done in advance.  Optionally, add the salt to this mixture.
2. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl (use salt if not added to the sweetener above).  Add the chilled butter in small pieces.  Blend the fat and flour with a pastry blender or your hands until the mixture resembles a course crumb.  Add the (preferrably frozen) blueberries, cover and place in refridgerator.
3. Preheat the oven to 400`$\degrees$` and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.
4. Blend the eggs, creamer and date/fig mixture in a blender until well mixed.  
5. Fold the liquid mixture into the chilled dry ingredients.  Turn out onto a working surface and carefully form into a circular shape, 1 inch in thickness.  Cut into 10 slices and carefully place the slices on the baking sheet.  Bake for 20-22 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack.
