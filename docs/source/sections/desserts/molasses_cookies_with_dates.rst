Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, protein powder, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.
3. In a blender, beat together the eggs, MCT oil, dates, almond milk, and molasses.
4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until combined.  The dough should be thick enought to roll into balls, but not as thick as Play-Doh.
5. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes to let harder.  Roll into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheet.  Sligthly flatten the cookies with the bottom of a glass.
6. Bake for 15 minutes.  Halfway through baking, remove from oven and mark with a fork to like traditional molasses cookies.
