      - Square dark chocholate

Steps
^^^^^

1.  In a small microwave-safe mug or ramekin, mix together the dry ingredients.  This can be prepared.
2.  Right before cooking, add the remaining ingredients, less the chocholate square.  Once a smooth batter is obtained, push the square into the center until fully submerged.
3.  Microwave on high for 30-40 seconds (don't overcook).  Edges will be set, and the center gooey.  Allow to cool for 1-2 minutes.
